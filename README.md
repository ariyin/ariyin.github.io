## pages

### home
toro inoue world domination! featuring a design like a nintendo game console and many toro inoue reactions.

### about
the usual college introduction that's like name, year, major and a short blurb about my professional and personal interests. you also get to check out my very good music taste and see how you can contact me (spoiler: there are not that many ways, but if you like discord you may also message me @jayenay).

### projects
since i'm interested in both coding and ui/ux / design, i kind of have to feature different projects that demonstrate my skills in either aspect.

for a quick reference of projects i've worked on:
- [this portfolio](ariyin.github.io) (you are here right now)
- [vroomin](https://www.figma.com/proto/fcOewlDV3eUSCCBXPx1ZJv/vroomin?page-id=0%3A1&type=design&node-id=37-3516&viewport=21%2C361%2C0.36&t=M6PgGAB2WC8J0DwX-1&scaling=scale-down&starting-point-node-id=1%3A2&show-proto-sidebar=1&mode=design) (google ux design project 2)

### resume
not an actual page, but links to my most recently updated resume! for those who want to stalk my gpa and know what i've been up to academically and extracurricularly.

## todo
aka some of my future plans for this site. i have a lot of things i want to do, but very little time (college classes eat away most of my time unfortunately)...
- revamping projects (quality over quantity)
    - content
    - using react chips
    - navigation within the project page
    - how they're displayed (kind of lame right now)
- more game references, such as:
    - background music (that you can turn off of course)
    - design that references toro inoue let's party (speech bubbles, text, etc)
- better background designs (plain beige isn't cutting it anymore)
- more animations
- code cleanup (it's a bit messy right now)
- website themes (in the far future when i become a real pro, for example toro inoue is one theme, and another theme could be y2k)

## got feedback?
if you have any feedback about anything about this repo or site, please let me know! whether that's ways i can optimize the code, git gud at design, or include better content. i am open to any constructive critcism that lets me improve :3

maybe when i have time i'll include an anonymous feedback form on the site lol.
