# jenna wang's portfolio
this portfolio is powered by [vite](https://vitejs.dev/) and deployed via [github pages](https://pages.github.com/). the code was written using: html, css, javascript, react, and markdown (for this readme lol).

## commands
- to start: `npm start`
- to update gh-pages: `yarn deploy`

## pages

### home
toro inoue world domination! featuring a design like a game console and many toro inoue emoticons.

### about
the usual college introduction that's like name, year, major and a short blurb about my professional and personal interests. you also get to check out my very good music taste and see how you can contact me (spoiler: there are not that many ways, but if you like discord you may also message me @jayenay).

### projects
check them out! for coding projects, feel free to looked at the pinned repos or my own repos. for ui projects, check them out in my website!

### resume
not an actual page, but links to my most recently updated resume! for those who want to stalk my gpa and know what i've been up to academically and extracurricularly.

## todo
aka some of my future plans for this site. i have a lot of things i want to do, but very little time (college classes eat away most of my time unfortunately)...
- revamping projects (quality over quantity)
    - content
    - navigation within the project page
- more game references, such as:
    - background music (that you can turn off of course)
    - design that references toro inoue let's party (speech bubbles, text, etc)
- better background designs (plain beige isn't cutting it anymore)
- more animations
- code cleanup (it's a bit messy right now)
- website themes (in the far future when i become a real pro, for example toro inoue is one theme, and another theme could be y2k)

## got feedback?
if you have any feedback about anything about this repo or site, please let me know! whether that's ways i can optimize the code, git gud at design, or include better content. i am open to any constructive criticism that lets me improve :3

maybe when i have time i'll include an anonymous feedback form on the site lol.
