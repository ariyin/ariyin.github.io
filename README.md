## todo

aka some of my future plans for this site. i have a lot of things i want to do, but very little time (college classes eat away most of my time unfortunately)...

- revamping projects (quality over quantity) and content
- better background designs (plain beige isn't cutting it anymore)
- an art dump!
- website themes (in the far future when i become a real pro, for example toro inoue is one theme, and another theme could be y2k)

## got feedback?

if you have any feedback about anything about this repo or site, please let me know! whether that's ways i can optimize the code, git gud at design, or include better content. i am open to any constructive criticism that lets me improve :3

maybe when i have time i'll include an anonymous feedback form on the site lol.
